 And the Boston Frank, I guess, is because I come in the way of a greater Boston.  I've been in LA for many years. I've heard a lot of important things.  But the thing that's really stuck out in my mind right from the first time I heard it,  is that we have to keep this program very simple.  It's been said that Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob's names are brought up here.  I'm not a named Dr. Bob, but it's been said that on his deathbed,  he said that Bill Wilson, Bill, if you keep it simple, it will work.  And ever since I heard that, I followed them, Bill Wilson, I ate.  I keep it simple. It has worked for me as it has worked for many, many years.  Everything I say here tonight, by the way, this is the night type of a group.  I can feel it already. A lot of times you're walking along.  I've done this many, many times. And you've got a feeling that you're not comfortable.  And that's happened to me, but I feel very comfortable here tonight.  My first, my last drunk lasted two and a half years.  I ended up in the south end of Boston, known as Skid Row.  And I lay down there in the filth, sucking on mine bottles for two and a half years,  throwing nickels and dimes, sleeping in all night movies,  like Tom Automobile, wherever.  But the thing I want to impress upon everyone here tonight is that I didn't plan that.  I didn't plan ending up in Skid Row in Boston.  The reason it happened is that I refused to believe it could happen.  I refused to believe there was anything in the face of the earth that could beat me in my hands and knees.  I refused to believe that alcohol or alcohol would exist.  And it took everything I had.  It took my health, my wealth, my sanity, my freedom, my dignity, my self-respect.  Anything and everything that you and I owned here and there, it took from me.  It always wasn't that way. I spent most of my life taking good care of myself.  I was a strength and health guy for many, many years.  My health, my appearance, was the most important thing in my life.  I took good care of death.  And I drank, but alcohol was not a problem.  I was always very much in control of my life.  The first time that I had a problem with alcohol to anyone,  including myself, because I was in New York, in the city,  I was at a party, I was listening to the horrors of these people that I turned out later to know.  And they took me to the Nicobarca Hospital,  and they were treating all kinds of drugs and knives.  And I wasn't drunk, and now he...  They treated me a little bit differently because I was all dressed up.  The people that brought me to the hospital were all too big both.  So the doctor today gave me a couple shots in the yarn.  He gave me a bag of pills and told me to do something about my drinking problem.  Now I was very much in control of my life.  At the time, so I did what he told me.  I quit drinking. I went down to Miami.  I was just awake.  Worked out a friend in Beach.  Got myself back in top condition.  I never really got out of top condition,  but I got myself back to real top condition.  And making a year went by, I'm not a count,  but making a year went by and I picked up another drink.  It was no big thing. I didn't say,  I'm going to take a drink out of sober 11 to 12 months.  I just picked up a drink.  Nothing really happened.  Now the year of sobering was five.  I was in another state.  And I got the same feeling one night that I got when I was in New York.  And I knew what to do.  Before the test was a point where I was in the horror,  I was in the deep seas.  I drove myself to the Press,  to Karen Hart from Philadelphia.  And I told the doctor in the emergency room,  I had a problem.  And I explained to him what was happening to me.  And we again, he gave me a shot in the eye.  Two doctors talked to me that night.  They wrote me on the stretcher for some pills.  And they told me I should do something about my life with alcohol.  Good night.  I get resentful.  Now in New York, I wasn't resentful.  But I get resentful for these two doctors in Philadelphia.  I should have known them.  There was something wrong.  I should have known them.  Again, I had a problem.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have got resentful.  But nevertheless, I took their advice.  I quit drinking.  I was still very much in control of my life.  I quit drinking.  I went out to California.  I went out to Muscle Beach.  And I worked out there with Nates for about a year.  Got myself again in top condition.  No beaching, no planting,  no tan, I've been sobo-ic to them out a month.  I picked up another drink.  I ended up in Boston.  And I went on a drunk in Boston that I could not get off.  If you had told me at any time in my life  that I was going to take a drink  and would put me on a drunk that I could not get off,  I would have told you you were crazy.  But I went on a drunk that I could not get off.  In every day, I would say  tomorrow I will do something about this.  One morning I woke up.  A lot of the things that happened from that day  until the day I came in away,  I don't remember too much about  but the things I remember are good for me.  This morning I woke up.  I was sick.  As sick as I have ever been in my life.  My face was swollen, my eyes were swollen.  I was a mad man.  I had all the buries that anyone in this room would get a half.  I had a lot of money.  Cadillac cars, diamond rings, tail made clothes.  And I was the sickest guy in North America  and didn't know it.  But I knew I wasn't rough.  But I knew how to get better.  I'll act of alchemy whether you like it or not.  The colors.  I was a strength and health guy all my life.  I was as tough as any guy that ever walked the street.  I was a street guy all my life.  I knew all the rules of the street.  In this morning I showed how much of a power I was.  I knew I needed help.  But I turned to the drink.  I knew the drink would get me better then.  I was so sick I couldn't hold a cigarette in my hand.  I looked in the mirror and I wanted to cry.  I went into another room.  Now this is how powerful alcohol is.  Within three hours with the best alcohol you can buy.  I wasn't singing more.  I looked in the mirror this time  and I looked like I was ready to go right to Hollywood, California and join in.  Alcohol was beginning to destroy my brains and I didn't know.  Three hours with the alcohol.  And I went from a guy who was so depressed  that he didn't want to look himself in the mirror  to a guy who thought he was ready to put on a pillow made clothes and drive away.  And from that day on I tried to get off of drunk and I couldn't do it.  Every morning I woke up and I tried to get better.  Now here's the thing, it may be happening to you  or it may have happened to you, don't let it happen again.  Every time I got better I forgot how sick I was.  And I drank again and I'd wake up in the morning  and I'd be definitely sick  and I'd drink to get better  and when I got better I forgot I was sick  all in the same day. That's sick.  The cars went, the clothes went, the money went, the drinks went, everything went.  I wouldn't walk out of my house  unless I looked like I stepped out of law and care.  Couldn't do that anymore.  I knew this street was good.  I made a push-up basket full of money with my brain on the street.  I knew where to go where people wouldn't say,  Who are you? You married, you single?  You don't look so good, you don't look so bad.  I knew where to go.  I knew this happened in the south end of Boston.  I went down in the south end of Boston.  They didn't ask me where I came from,  they didn't ask me if I was married or single.  All I wanted to know was, how much do you hold on?  You're gonna have enough for another drink.  If that's the singleest time in my life  it was less than a cup of wine  and 30 slices of bottle.  And that's all that we're interested in.  And that's all I came to be interested in.  I didn't want to hear nothing.  I didn't want to hear how sick you are, how bad you look.  I was afraid to hear it.  I was cowardly just like any acrobat.  They don't want to hear it.  I knew there was an insect.  And I didn't want to hear it.  And I laid down here and I sucked it in the wine bottle  day after day after day.  And I said, that's what's sick.  And I sucked on an 80 slices bottle of wine  and I get better.  And I forget I was sick.  That's sick.  From the end of that's sick.  It's happening. It happens to people.  Like you and me.  It just don't happen to the guy  you're seeing, right?  Get the rival, clean water, faucet.  It happens to people like you and me.  Like you and me.  It was destroyed.  I wouldn't get in.  I had a friend of mine  telling me, Frank,  you belong in a hospital.  Here is a guy  who spent over half of his life in the gymnasium.  I spent a brutal backpack full of money  on violent pills in the best clothes he could buy.  The best clothes he could wear.  I'm walking this thing through the stairs.  Oh, a guy tells me I belong in a hospital.  And I'm saying to him,  you can't prove him a hospital.  I'm going to get better tomorrow.  But my client was here and he caught  tears from the neck right underneath  in the bubble.  But they went around.  I clocked past them in the street.  They straightened me off the street.  They put me in the hospital.  They gave me up to death.  You know, looking close to die  when the police from the other news  were convincing me to do the last right.  There was a takeout of my alcohol.  I wasn't afraid to die.  I was playing there  when I was not afraid to die.  That's it.  I didn't care.  They had straps on me.  I was completely bananas.  I don't know how long, weeks, 10 days,  whatever it was.  One day  two guys from 88 walked into the hospital.  I don't know where they came from.  I couldn't even call them.  I couldn't have called them.  I'd never heard of 88.  You don't believe it?  I'm a grown man.  I've been from name to name.  I've got anything and everything  you're going to dream of doing.  I've never heard of 88.  So you know how many years ago that was?  Long time ago.  It was a classic one.  I'm laying there on the back of the tape.  I can't hold the cigarette in my hand.  I'm eating out the water.  This guy says to me,  you're having stronger alcohol.  If I could have fucked a lot, then I'd have a lot.  But I was too sick.  He said a few more things  and he said that too sick to talk to  we'll be back tomorrow.  The next day he came back again.  I know that I'm there.  I know that I'm there.  But I did say to him,  what are you all about?  Still a bunch of guys and girls  get together and talk about their problem  with alcohol.  And they help each other make it better.  He pressed all of them in his face.  Get them back and we'll be back tomorrow.  He came back the next day.  I'm not much better.  I can hold the cigarette in my hand  by now to strap the rocks.  I'm a very sick guy.  But I knew.  I know they were from A.A.  and I know they were coming back  and they came back.  We talked tomorrow.  I said to the guy,  what do you know about A.A.?  And he said, I love my A.A.  and lawful state prisons.  So I kind of listened a little bit.  I don't know. I was a street guy.  I know all about the street.  And I figured out  which is the town a little bit more.  It's like I thought, what?  So he told me how he got his A.A.  lawful state prison,  how long he's been sober.  And it was a very simple thing.  He said, all you do is do what we do  and then you'll get better.  You can't get much better than that.  So he says, when you get released from the hospital,  you'll take me what?  We'll take you to an A.A. thing.  Fair enough.  I didn't know where else to go.  I had a clothes that I had somewhere.  I didn't have 15 cents to my name.  I had no health, no brains.  I had nothing.  They were two full strangers.  Why, how many? I got a gold print.  They picked me up.  They put me in a meeting.  How the square came?  It was a mighty night.  I don't remember one thing  about the acceptance that he introduced me  to a guy named George.  That's how I remember.  I have to tell you that because that's how I remember.  The following night  there was something on the meeting  and I was in that.  I walked in the door  and I introduced you to a guy named Andy.  He looked at Andy and said, Mike,  you've got a problem with alcohol.  You need some help.  And Andy looked at me and said,  you've got a problem with alcohol  for the second time  in my adult life.  I admitted I need help  with anything.  First time I was in the hospital  and they asked me if I had a problem  and he asked me that night.  He said, you've got a problem with alcohol?  I said, yeah.  That's all he said. Yeah, let me down.  That was a complete surrender.  You'll never get out of here.  He said, if you want to get that,  here's what we'll get through.  Pay attention.  We said, if you want to get that,  you do what I tell you.  Standing right now.  I looked at it.  No one ever talked to me like that in my life.  I was afraid of him.  That was 28 years older than me.  I was afraid of him.  I was afraid of her.  But he was stern.  He was stern.  Thanks God for me.  He was stern.  He said, you go sit down front  and you listen and expect you know how.  There was a speaker meeting.  So when the meeting is over,  if you heard anything,  we don't understand you tell me.  And we'll figure this thing out.  I didn't open my mouth.  I didn't open my mouth  for a long, long time.  Every night  they took, they got me to Rome.  And every night  they picked me up  and took me to a meeting.  I sat down front  and I listened the best way I knew how.  Every night  they picked me up,  took me to another meeting.  I sat down front  and listened the best way I knew how.  I was sick.  I was scared.  I had never,  never had them scared in my life.  I never was fearful  of anything in my  as-out life.  And so I got sober when I ate.  But that was pain  I had as a throat.  And they told me right up front  they said frankly  when I had to go through all this pain  and agony.  I said I can't, there's no more pain  that I can go through, that I haven't gone through.  He said be patient, pal.  You're going to go through some pain.  And we met from the chin up  the emotion  Will I can I?  Will I make it? Can I make it?  Will I drink? Will I drink?  It's terrible.  But you can do it and I've done it.  I've done it.  I've done what they told me to do  and I made it.  I made it a day at a time  after I was sober about three months.  I say  I'm not a counter, I still don't count.  They say we're going to need a few more things  to think about.  They say don't compare your life  with alcohol with any of the people  you've already heard  or any of the people you've been lucky  and you've been here after seeing life.  And they explained it like this  very simple.  They said you'll hear a guy  or a girl get up and say  the thing that brought them  to their first meeting  and you may say  I had more trouble when I was sober.  And they told me that if I ever  walked out of an England meeting  with that kind of negative thinking  I was carrying home a bushel of facts  to pull a problem but I couldn't have it.  Then they said you might hear a guy  or a girl get up  and tell them about the problems  that brought them to their first meeting  and you may say  poor guy, poor girl  oh misery, the tragedy they went through.  They told me if I carried that  out of an England meeting  without sharing it  it was very negative.  They said I had a share  and thought if I had it  because life was carrying home  a bushel of facts to pull a problem  I couldn't have it.  And they were right.  And after a few more months from by  they said we give a few more things  to think about.  They said you got to get completely  honest with yourself.  You got to get completely honest  with the overall problem  and you have to be completely  honest with the people who are trying to help you.  And if you don't  you won't make it.  If you don't  you won't make it.  Now I listen very carefully tonight.  And I've done  everything they told me to do  and I've done it every day.  If you know why I've done it  I want it to get better.  I want it to get better.  Then they told me  I couldn't have  any reservations.  I couldn't have any  resentments.  I couldn't have any  little feelings for anything.  They told me I didn't have a right  to have any feelings.  They said if you have all these negative things  happening in your life  then you'll have reservations.  And when you have reservations  you'll get drunk.  And it's that simple.  Very simple.  And I listen very carefully  and I found exactly  what they told me to do when I've done it  every day.  You know why I've done it every day?  I want it to get better.  Every night they picked me up  and every night we went to a meeting  and I listened the best way  I know how about fun.  And once in a while  I said something.  That might have to say something.  Then I knew  they come to try  when you know you're getting a little bit better.  Now I thought I was  a strength and health guy all my life  and by this time I'm going to move  job as a janitor.  I'm not a janitor but that's  what I got as a job.  And I saved a few bucks  and I bought a set of weights  and I started working out.  Now I knew my parents  were very important to me  and I knew my body was doing  I can't need something to go on.  And then I learned to do the things  way too often I bought  a suit for $11.  Now let me tell you now  I was a guy  and what ever made clothes on my life  were can-lacks, old can-lacks  guys, silent range.  Well I made a fortune faster  full of money and I was impressed  with that one suit I bought.  I was so impressed that night  I went to a meeting and told everybody there  that I had just bought a suit  I was getting to see.  They didn't know  what made me feel so good about that  I was so honest with my own spirit.  I didn't hide nothing  I didn't say  I'm going to save up and buy a $300 suit  I got a $11 class  and I bought the suit  in a hot shop  and I was grateful I was able to do it.  No glad to go to 28  take it to the bank  I was great  in my life went on.  Coming up on my first anniversary  they said  you're going to spend your own  meeting tonight  or it's dumb talk  you know what to say  you know what to say  but I gave my own meeting  I had my sponsor and two other guys  talk. That's all I did  was introduce them  after the meeting  this guy came up to me and said  Frank  good to see you when I ever heard  I thought  I didn't say these things  that's why  these are the kind of people  I don't know  anyway  about a week later  I said to my sponsor  anyway I said  I got my first anniversary  guys were up there talking  95 days sober  4 months sober  6 months sober  you

Parliamentary  you don't even want to speak it  you're not going to feel telling  and I said oh  of course  I said what if I told what I told  and then that's it  it was this time  you stand in front

the audience  I spot a half a dozen guys I know  by the first night  then it was these  and I ended up like  saying something that I know  they didn't like but I did  and I said when I'm going home

years I was in AA  I guess I went to a thousand meetings  no big thing  no big thing  the reason I went to a thousand meetings  or more the first  years I was in AA  I wanted to get better  I wanted to get better  after I was sober  oh I don't know  a couple of years  I had no confidence  no confidence  to talk  I was told I was getting better  I was working my brain was working  a little bit

in Everest  we'd like you to be a speaker  and if you don't need me  if you need my sponsor  he speaks to all these anniversaries  and thank you not me  no we want you  I said I'll have to ask my sponsor  I didn't think  I was sold for almost 4 years  I had to find out  from my sponsor  if it was good enough for me  was I ready for this  no big deal on this guy  when I couldn't end up before  I had an ego as big as the Grand Canyon  I lost it here  I grew up here  I caught my sponsor and said  Andy they love you to speak  at an anniversary in Everest  Matt you know what he said so what  I thought he was going to say  oh you were Ryan  you know  he said  it's an anniversary  it's an anniversary  it's usually a meaning  but it's sort of cool  I thought several weeks out  but he said  many times that  a lot of people go to conventions  a lot of people go to anniversaries  a lot of people go to  different meetings  speaking meetings  it usually don't go to meetings  so give them help  I said  wouldn't come with me  he said sure  so he and I and this guy  we were working on it all the time  they called me  they called me in the park  I get out of my park  it's something that I had to do  and they gave me a big embrace  my head fat  I lose the pumps on my back  I said  you know  so I let my fat down  and Andy was like  I'll let it go to your head Frank  I don't think you were that good  that was my father  he saved my family  he kept me right where I was supposed to be  and he's the one that told me  you have to go through  what you have to go through  you have to get all the pain  you're going to have to feel all the pain  you're not going to miss anything  he said if you are doing  what you're supposed to be doing  anyway  you're not going to miss anything  you're not going to miss anything  wherever you are  is where you're supposed to be  no matter how much it hurts  wherever you are  is where you're supposed to be  but he's living in the south of Europe  I believe him  I miss him so much  I family told me  and saved one on  weeks one on months one on  years one on  many guys  and I became more  after the A.A  everything  he told me  I told  people who I was  part of the A.A  you wanted me  better you do what I tell you  it works for me  it might work for you  wherever you are  you have no life in A.A  if you are  sincere  if you're doing the best you can  that's where you're supposed to be  there's no double promotion  you have to go through all the pain  you have to go through  but one day  it starts to get a little bit easier  then one day it starts to get  a little more easier  and then it becomes a little balanced  in your life and then  how glad you are you're here  they told me  you go to meeting  you go to meeting  I never heard 90 meetings in 90 days  maybe they said  but I never heard it  what I did here was this  you go to meeting  you continue to go to meeting  and you go to meeting  then who do you want to go to meeting  so that makes a lot of sense  then you become comfortable  then you get some balance  in your life  they were right  always they were right  I never found it necessary  to find fault  with anyone who was trying to help me  never  never found it necessary  to find fault  with anyone who was trying to help me  with my problems  I found what they told me  to do I shared  I shared the good feelings  I shared the bad things  I had bad nights I shared  my first year in A.A.  was a nightmare  I had horrors  I had  nightmares you wouldn't believe  I'd rate up three  but every night it happened  the next day  I would share it with whoever picked me  out of my house  I'd say you know what happened to me last night  you know what you used to say to me  you continue to do what you're doing  right now  and maybe it'll get better  and I heard it  oh  oh  continue to do what you're doing today  and maybe it'll get better  tomorrow  but I believe them  that's what saved me  I believe them  and they were right  they were right  I never found it necessary  one day in my life in A.A.  to find fault with anyone  who was trying to help me  this is why I'm here tonight  telling you  it worked  but you gotta work at it  you don't slide in  you don't slide back  you know  I've been in A.A. a long time  and the thousands of me  I've had hundreds of pigeons  and I've run across  a lot of very successful people  people who are  comfortable  that good balance in their life  life is nice  my wife and I were talking about this the other night  how many people we know  have nice balance in their life  you know what these people are  the people who work the program  every day  every day  no pain, no strife  no nothing  nothing  but I have met other people  who after they go about it  come out a month for you  they say  I think I'll go mighty  in fright  and in a minute  I'll say to you mate  we'll get a few more candles  and a few more cakes  and they say  I think I'll go to my own  and I'm waiting to get to say me  and then we find a real idiot  after a certain amount of time  and they wait  I think I can follow it in  a minute  it don't work  it don't work  you know  for the first ten years that I was speaking in the A.A.  if you was last when I was talking  I'd have got upset  they tell me since I've lived in Florida  which is about nine years  that I know  I just know  I don't see how  but they say I go so I believe  I used to be worse  than that  but A.A.  works  if you work at it  the day you stop working at it  it don't work no more  you can take that to the back  then don't breathe these tears  you don't do like nothing  you better work  but then  if you do it right  you get comfortable  and you get some balance in your life  and you get some serenity  it is not the life people  and people have a life you know  tired it works it's nice  I've thought for the longest time  I'm gonna have problems with it  but I've done what they told me  to do when I got it every day  there was a time when I used to have  all these bad nightmares I told you about  the one night  they were dropping me off with my foreign assistant  and he said  track it if you have another one of them bad nights  do what I used to do  first  he drove away  a couple of nights later  I'm going through a bad time  bad bad time  I'm awake bad time  I get on my knees  now I could talk for five days  and I'd never talk about God  or prayer  or 12 steps  you know you commit A to A  you do what you're supposed to do  and all these things will happen to you  I don't have to say that  I can tell you that you can't make it  you better work this program  but  this night it happens  and I get on my knees  now when I was Catholic  I was an altar boy for 12 years  so I knew all the prayers  all the prayers you want I know  but this night  instead  I get on my knees  and I say Dear God  I'm trying to do something with my life  in your prayers  that was the first form of prayer  and I said hang in  no prayer to the light  and no big thing happening  but I did pray that night  and every night  I said  many many years  I get on my knees  before I go to bed  and I ask the power behind the program  of the after-house analysis  to help me with my after-house prayer  I have never met this night  never met this night  never found it necessary  to say God  that's me  work on it  but it's not you  it works  every day  I get up  I get on my knees  and I ask the power behind the program  of the after-house analysis  to help me with my after-house prayer  let me do something  that's right today  I get up I do that  my wife and I  I have a party  she goes to work  I go to work  life is beautiful  I went to her from home  she waits for me to come home  we are so happy  we are successful people in the A.A  we got an A.A. meeting  she's more involved in A.A.  life is very very good  I never found it necessary  from when my brain started to clear up  to change any of the rules  people said  there's no rules in A.A  I got rules for you  I got rules for you  you may not think they're rules  but they're you better  you better  and I've been doing it  I do it every day  I am the most happy  contented guy  to ever do on this platform  to remember I said  I am a very happy contented guy  and I owe every single citizen  not the house department  to the change in my content  to the clothes on my back  if you don't think you do  you probably get what  here one drink  before you've lost it all  remember that  let me remind you that  some of you might be fooling around with the program  there isn't a person in this room  there isn't a person in the house  there isn't a person in the cloud  that can tell me  what will happen to them  if they take another drink of alcohol  you don't know  where you're gonna go  what you'll do when you get there  how it will affect you mentally or physically  or if you'll ever have another day of time  remember  when you get it right here  you don't know  where you're gonna go  what you'll do when you get there  how it will affect you mentally or physically  or if you'll ever have another day of time  remember  I've had a lot of people say for me  I came in here  I've been tired of the ride  I had a nice job  no one in this room  had more respect for themselves  than I did  before I took that one drink  that put me on the ground  that I couldn't get off  that tore me right down  of my hands and knees  it had made a nothing happen  it took my brain  it scrambled on my jaw  I remember one night  it was a skid row and I had enough money  to get a $0.55  in an all night movie  but before I went in I had two bottles  that must get out of line  $0.85 a bottle  my friend and I went in  about an hour in the movie  he passed the dollar on me  and I'm sitting there  now I have been in this movie many times  but this night  I started to smell the place  I could smell it  it was rotten  it was filthy and so was I  and I looked around  I said, dear God  what am I doing here?  but like he asked about me  he was a coward  and I was home  I couldn't take that kind of pain  so I picked up the bottle of wine  $0.85 and before I had it  finished  I was enjoying a houseway movie  that's how the house went  out of the movie  destroys your brain  it destroys your brain  if you don't think it's 10  maybe you should check yourself  in somewhere tonight  alcohol will destroy everyone  in this room  absolutely can drink again  it will take your health  your wealth, your sanity  your freedom, your dignity  self respect  walk in the bar  and before you want to drink  put it all on the bar  whether you like it or not  that's where it will cost you  and most of all it will cost you your sanity  and you may never  never have an opportunity  to sort of make a meeting again  I didn't make that up  I didn't involve  an institution  of many many years in AA  and I see people  sitting out in meetings  in the prison  in that meeting on the street  and we still don't believe  that's what happens  it's just  I just  stick to my stomach  when I say people say  it won't happen to me  I'm in control  if you're in control of your life  you're going to spend this meeting tonight  if you're in control of your life  you're going to come to the prison in a meeting  you're going to look after the health  in order to get the health  you've got to get complete surrender  here I am, Allah  find me  the people I know will help you  but they've got to let them help you  you can't be smilin  you can't do with your life  your life is up  my life is up  I've done everything  I've ever wanted to in this life  I've looked at this messed up trouble  and it was so clear  when I got out of AA  I knew they'd call me  complete and full surrender  and maybe you were going to step  I believed them  they were right in their work  in their work  and it's been working  every day since  my life is good  the people I hang around with  their life is good  we're reasonably  consensus happy people  you know  people say I'm not a high guy  I'm not a high guy  my life is good  a lot of wonderful  things have happened to me  I started to make a little progress  I had this job I showed you for 14 years  about 7 years into the job  I got a nice house  with my old house  you know  way out of my  character  I deserved  I was a nice guy  I did do it to have nice things  then  maybe 6, 7, 8 years later  I bought a whole town in New Hampshire  life was coming along pretty good  I'm telling you about these serious things  because  I don't know if they're going to happen to you  you may stay in the same job for 50 years  but these things  happened to me  because I was sober in 88  I've done what I was supposed to do in 88  the opportunity came and I got  I got rid of the whole town in New Hampshire  I went to flower  I was in Florida  a couple of weeks ago  during the drill  I got active in the drill  the day before  my life was good  everything was good  if nothing more  happened to me in my life  I would have been the most  fortunate guy that ever came  to an 88 year  but better things wouldn't happen  you didn't believe  better things would happen  I was hearing of me  I was about to hear a meaning  and why go on a Sunday night  I looked out in the audience  I'd seen this beautiful drunk  and I just walked  I gotta meet her  so before I got the meaning  I walked all the way  I introduced myself  I'd sung Frank  he'd sung Bobby  we talked  that song on Friday was my anniversary  I invited her to my anniversary  at our anniversary down there  we had meeting meetings and all that good stuff  and I was going to be the speaker  after the meeting she came  and after the meeting she said to me  I didn't know where people were going to say  but I knew where people were going to say  I just didn't know how you were going to say it  and I kind of looked out  funny and I said okay  that Sunday  two days later I was to see a woman  who was in the hospital with cancer  who was an 88  so I said if you'd like to come with me  to the hospital because this is just a woman  an 88  I'll take you out to Changi Center  she said sorry  I told you when you see this woman  at the hospital  and that night she was at Changi Center  and that night we walked on the beach  that's kind of romantic, huh?  the next night she came to my house to death  we were going to have a dinner every night spent  we weren't together for years  and she said to me one night  if you'd like to get married  that's a great idea  and we were married  we were married  two years and two months  a lovely lady sitting over there  I thought  that I had got it all  and my life was complete  and I was barely involved in A.A.  and I was a happy, contented guy  he had made my life  that more  complete  I'm a very, very happy  contented guy  every night  including tonight  shooting on one side of the bed  I'll be on the other  we'll thank the cow behind the program  of A.A.  for another good day in A.A.  another good day in life  and I'll thank the higher power  for her  and my life is good  the girl life is good  become good  we're in action  we really enjoy ourselves  we have a nice life here  we have a nice motel  things go right tonight  we might take a while  come right down here  I say this  just like you  I talked to a guy the other day  he's having a special batch  that's called the Kilsom's life  and I said  what a nice ceremony it is  to wake up in the morning  make each time you're walking along  you pick it up in your right stone  from the front page  and it makes you agree  we can't do that  I can  and you  A.A.  will work  if you let us do it  I had a vision one time  I  left him in the city hospital  in Boston  a very wealthy guy  he spent money like an immigrant  at that time he was here  and I was the chef  and the Boston father was making 90 bucks a week  that really had nothing to do with it  but this guy was an immediate and  very insolvential guy  all kinds of degrees  stigma  we left him in the hospital  they said  as he saved his life he was leaving  and apparently the point is this  they saved his life they put him in a healthy life  and then all these  very insolvential friends came  and blah blah blah  so anyway I was just seeing him in the hospital  I got him in a big book  he thanked me for saving his life  I said I'll take you a lot of money  I'll take you to an A.A.  like they did to me  fine  we lived in Maine for about six months  and he was getting better  he was getting a little bit better  he knew what we were doing  he knew what he was doing  he was a lawyer  he knew all he was trying to get together  then one night  he said thank you  you're a great guy  anything I could ever do for you  you let me know  he said but  he's been taking me to  I take him down a skit row  a soft stand  I mean I used to take my meetings  where half the guys in the room had time  thought was in their pockets  he said they're not my type  I said what  I said  everyone in this room  we just like  we're all here with an alcoholic problem  I don't care if it comes from Maine  where you come from  Yale or Yale or Harvard  everyone in this room  with an alcoholic problem  is the same type  there's only one big book  it's for the young  the old  the rich the poor  the girls  one big book  and if you don't think so  you've got big problems  they didn't make books for boys  they didn't make books for girls  and they didn't make books for old people  and young people  rich people and old people  one big book  alcohol is for young  it's for me  and we better work this program  the exact same way  everyone in this room is my type  you've got an alcoholic problem  I've got an alcoholic problem  we're the same  I work it the best way I know how  you work it the best way you know how  we're still even  if you don't think I'm your type  you've got a problem  if I don't think you're my type  I've got a problem  no rules  for anyone  the same rules for everyone  there's only one big book  and it's for all  you will listen  keep this  there's not my type  listen  this guy  always drinking  always flaccid on the wall  all the money he had  he couldn't get it through his head  you're an alcoholic first  everything else is second  you don't have a second  unless you're an alcoholic  there's no second  it has to be the number one singer  you don't like the number one singer  in my life  what are we going to do about it  if we don't make it number one  we don't have a number two  he refused to believe that  he didn't want to know  he didn't want me to know he was drinking  so he went to Miami and broke up  there's a sick guy who was watching  Miami and broke up  he ended up in a crying out place  in Connecticut and he died  I'll fix you my right arm  after the kill of the place  you think you're so much for that  kill of the night  you need to do everything you could  to stay sober in AA  you don't have that opportunity  to do what I do  you
