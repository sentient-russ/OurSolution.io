 And the Boston Frank, I guess, is because I come in the way of a greater Boston.  I've been in LA for many years. I've heard a lot of important things.  But the thing that's really stuck out in my mind right from the first time I heard it,  is that we have to keep this program very simple.  It's been said that Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob's names were brought up here.  I'm not a named Dr. Bob, but it's been said that on his deathbed,  he said that Bill Wilson, Bill, if you keep it simple, it will work.  And ever since I heard that, I followed them, Bill, when I ate.  I keep it simple.  It has worked for me as it has worked for many, many years.  Everything I say here tonight, by the way, this is the night type of a group.  I can feel it already.  A lot of times you're walking along. I've done this many, many times.  And you've got a feeling that you're not comfortable.  And that's happened to me, but I feel very comfortable here tonight.  In fact, my first, my last drunk lasted two and a half years.  I ended up in the south end of Boston, known as Skid Row.  And I lay down there and I felt like I'm on mine bottles for two and a half years,  throwing nickels and dimes, sleeping in all night movies,  like I got on my bills, whatever.  But the thing I want to impress upon everyone here tonight is that I didn't plan that.  I didn't plan on ending up in Skid Row in Boston.  The reason it happened is that I refused to believe it could happen.  I refused to believe there was anything in the face of the earth that could beat me in my hands and knees.  I refused to believe that alcohol or alcohol would exist.  And it took everything I had.  It took my health, my wealth, my sanity, my freedom, my dignity, my self-respect.  Anything and everything that you and I owned here and there, it took from me.  It always wasn't that way.  I spent most of my life taking good care of myself.  I was a strength and health guy for many, many years.  My health, my appearance, was the most important thing in my life.  I took good care of death.  And I drank, but alcohol was not a problem.  I was always very much in control of my life.  The first time that I had a problem with alcohol to anyone,  including myself, was when I was in New York, in the city.  I was at a party.  I listened to the horrors of these people that I turned out later to know.  And they took me to the Nicaragua Hospital.  And they were treating all kinds of crimes and knives.  And I wasn't drunk.  Now, they treat me a little bit differently because I was all dressed up.  The people that brought me to the hospital were all too big both.  So the doctor today gave me a couple shots in the yarn.  He gave me a bag of pills and told me to do something about my drinking problem.  Now, I was very much in control of my life.  At the time, so I did what he told me.  I quit drinking.  I went down to Miami.  I was just awake.  Worked out in Brandon Beach.  Got myself back in top condition.  I never really got out of top condition,  but I got myself back to real top condition.  And making a year went by, I'm not a count,  but making a year went by and I picked up another drink.  It was no big thing.  I didn't say, I'm going to take a drink out of sober 11 or 12 months.  I just picked up a drink.  Nothing really happened.  Another year or so went by.  I was in another state.  And I got the same feeling.  One night that I got when I was in New York.  And I knew what to do.  Before the test was a point where I was in the heart.  I was in the deep seas.  I drove myself to the Press,  which is in the heart of Philadelphia.  And I told the doctor in the emergency room,  I had a problem.  And I explained to him what was happening to me.  And we again, he gave me a shot in the yarn.  Two doctors talked to me that night.  They wrote me out the stretcher for some pills.  And they told me I should do something about my life of alcohol.  Good night.  I get resentful.  Now in New York I wasn't resentful.  But I get resentful for these two doctors in Philadelphia.  I should have known them.  There was something wrong.  I should have known them.  Then I had a problem.  Otherwise I wouldn't have got resentful.  But nevertheless, I took their advice.  I quit drinking.  I was still very much in control of my life.  I quit drinking.  I went out to California.  I went out to Muscle Beach.  And I worked out there with grace for about a year.  Got myself again in top condition.  No big thing.  No plan thing.  No tan.  I've been sober all X amount of months.  I picked up another drink.  I ended up in Boston.  And I went on a drunk in Boston that I could not get off.  If you had told me at any time in my life  that I was going to take a drink  and would put me on a drunk that I could not get off,  I would have told you you were crazy.  But I've been on a drunk that I could not get off.  In every day, I would say,  tomorrow I will do something about this.  One morning I woke up.  A lot of the things that happened from that day  until the day I came in away,  I don't remember too much about  but the things I remember are good for me.  This morning I woke up.  I was sick.  As sick as I have ever been in my life.  My face was swollen.  My eyes were swollen.  I was a mad man.  I had all the buries that anyone in this room would care to have.  I had a lot of money.  Cadillac cars, diamond rings,  tail made clothes.  And I was the sickest guy in North America  and didn't know it.  But I knew I wasn't rough.  But I knew how to get better.  I'll act of alchemy whether you like it or not.  The colors.  I was a strength and health guy all my life.  I was as tough as any guy that ever walked the street.  I was a street guy all my life.  I knew all the rules of the street.  And this morning I showed how much of a power I was.  I knew I needed help but I turned to the drink.  I knew the drink would get me better then.  I was so sick I couldn't hold a cigarette in my hand.  I looked in the mirror and I wanted a crack.  I went into another room.  Now this is how powerful alcohol is.  Within three hours with the best alcohol you can buy.  I wasn't singing more.  I looked in the mirror this time  and I looked like I was ready to go right to Hollywood, California and join in.  Alcohol was beginning to destroy my brains and I didn't know.  Three hours with the alcohol.  And I went from a guy who was so depressed  that he didn't want to look himself in the mirror  to a guy who thought he was ready to put on a pillow made close  and drive away.  And from that day on I tried to get off of drunk and I couldn't do it.  Every morning I woke up and I tried to get better.  Now here's the thing, it may be happening to you  or it may have happened to you, don't let it happen again.  Every time I got better I forgot how sick I was.  And I drank again and I'd wake up in the morning  and I'd be definitely sick and I'd drink to get better.  And when I got better I forgot I was sick all in the same day.  That's sick.  The cars went, the clothes went, the money went, the drinks went, everything went.  I wouldn't walk out of my house unless I looked like I stepped out of law and care.  Couldn't do that anymore.  I knew this street was good.  I made a bus so fast that full of money with my brain was on the street.  I knew where to go where people wouldn't stay.  Who are you? You married, you single?  You don't look so good, you don't look so bad.  I knew where to go.  I knew this happened in the south end of Boston.  I went down in the south end of Boston.  They didn't ask me where I came from.  They didn't ask me if I was married or single.  All I wanted to know was how much you hold on.  You're gonna have enough for another drink.  If that's the singleest time in my life that was left with our wine  and three slices of bottle.  And that's all that we're interested in.  And that's all I can to be interested in.  I didn't want to hear nothing.  I didn't want to hear how sick you are, how bad you look.  I was a friend to hear it.  I was cowardly just like any acrobat.  They don't want to hear it.  I knew there was an insect.  And I didn't want to hear it.  And I laid down here and I sucked it in the wine bottle  day after day after day.  And I just felt we sick.  And I sucked on an 85-cent bottle of wine  and I just fed up.  And I forget I was sick.  That's sick.  From the end of that's sick.  It's happening.  It happens to people.  Like you and me.  It just don't happen to the guy in New York City.  Rockets, rivals, clean water, faucets.  It happens to people like you and me.  Like you and me.  It was destroyed.  I wouldn't get in.  I had a friend of mine.  He said to me, Frank, you belong in a hospital.  Here is a guy who spent over half of his life in his gymnasium.  I spent a brutal backpack full of money  on violent pills in the best clothes he could buy.  The best clothes he could wear.  I'm walking this place and see a girl.  A guy tells me I'd be wrong in a hospital.  And I'm saying to him,  you can't prove him a hospital.  I'm going to get better tomorrow.  But if my clients would hear me talk,  hear it from the neck right underneath,  in the bubble.  But they went around.  I clocked half an hour in the street.  They straightened me off the street.  They put me in the hospital.  They gave me up to death.  You know, looking for the guy  when the police threw me out of the building  and sent me to the last place.  There was a takeout of my alcohol.  I wasn't afraid to die.  I was playing there when I was not  afraid to die.  That's it.  I didn't care.  They had straps on me.  I was completely bananas.  I don't know how long, weeks,  10 days, whatever it was.  One day,  two guys from 88 walked into the house.  I don't know where they came from.  I said we didn't call them.  I couldn't call them.  I never heard of 88.  You don't believe it?  I'm a grown man.  I've been from name to fame.  I've got anything and everything  you're going to dream of doing.  I never heard of 88.  So you know how many years ago that was?  Long time ago.  It was a classic one.  I'm laying there on the back of the tape.  I can't hold the cigarette in my hand.  I'm giving out the water.  This guy says to me,  you're having stronger alcohol.  If I could have fought the last thing out a lot,  but I was too sick,  he said a few more things and he said  that too sick to talk to, we'll be back tomorrow.  The next day he came back again.  I know that I'm there.  I know that I'm there.  But I did say to him, what's that you're all about?  Still a bunch of guys and girls get together.  They talk about their problem with alcohol.  And they help each other and they get better.  He's not all I'm going to say.  Get them back.  We'll be back tomorrow.  He came back the next day.  I'm not much better.  I can hold the cigarette in my hand  right now to strap the rock.  I'm a very sick guy.  But I knew  I knew they were from AA  and I knew they were coming back  and they came back.  We talked tomorrow  and I said to the guy,  what do you know about AA?  And he said, I love my AA  and lawful state prison.  So I kind of listened a little bit.  I don't know. I was a street guy  who all about the street.  And I figured out  which is this guy a little bit more.  He's sick as I was.  So he told me how he got his AA  lawful state prison  along with him so back.  And  it was a very simple thing.  He said, all you do  is do what we do and hey, you'll get better.  You can't get much better than that.  So he says, when you get released  from the hospital, you'll take me back.  We'll take you to an AA.  Fair enough.  I had nowhere else to go.  I had a clothes  that I had somewhere.  I didn't have 15 cents to my name.  I had no health, no brains.  I had nothing.  There were two full strangers.  They picked me up.  They put me in a meeting.  I was square in town.  It was a mighty night.  I don't remember one thing  about the acceptance that he introduced me  or got me into drugs.  But I don't remember.  I have to tell you that because that's  all I remember.  The following night, they told me  what meeting and I was in that.  They walked in the door and they introduced me  to a guy named Andy.  He said Andy, this is fine.  He's got a problem with alcohol.  You need some help.  And Andy looked at me and he said,  you've got a problem with alcohol  for the second time  in my adult life.  I admit it.  I need help with anything.  First time I was in the hospital  and they asked me if I had a problem.  And he asked me that night.  He said, you've got a problem with alcohol?  I said, yeah.  That's all he said. Yeah.  That was a complete surrender.  You'll never get out of here.  He said, if you want to get that,  here's what we'll get through.  Pay attention.  We said, if you want to get that,  you do what I tell you.  Standing right now.  I looked at it.  No one ever talked to me like that  in my life.  I was afraid of him.  That was 20 years older than me.  I was afraid of him.  I was afraid of her.  But he was stern.  Thanks God, to me,  he was stern.  He said, you go sit down in front  and you listen and expect  you know how.  There was a speaker meeting.  So when the meeting is over,  if you heard anything,  you don't understand, you tell me.  And we'll figure this thing out.  I didn't open my mouth.  I didn't open my mouth  for a long, long time.  Every night  they took, they got me to Rome.  And every night  they picked me up  and took me to a meeting.  I sat down in front  and I listened the best way I knew how.  Every night  they picked me up,  took me to another meeting.  I sat down in front  and listened the best way I knew how.  I was sick.  I was scared.  I would never,  never have been scared  in my life.  I never was fearful  of anything in my  as-out life.  And so I got sober and I ate.  But that was pain I had  of a stroke.  And they told me to write a sign.  They said, frankly,  I have to go through all this pain  and agony.  I said, I can't, there's no more pain  that I can go through, that I haven't  gone through.  He said, be patient, pal.  You're going to go through some pain.  And he meant from the cannot  the emotion  will I can I  will I make it, can I make it  will I drink, will I drink  it's terrible  but you can do it and I've done it.  I've done it.  I've done what they told me to do  and I've made it.  I made it a day at a time  after I was sober  about three months.  I say, I'm not a counter  I still don't count.  They say there's  even a few more things to say about it.  They say, don't continue  your life without alcohol  with any of the people you've already heard  or any of the people you've  been lucky and you've been here  after seeing life.  And they explained it like this.  Very simple.  They said, you'll hear a guy  or girl get up and say  the thing you just brought  into their first meeting  and you may say  I had more trouble when I was sober.  And they told me that if I  ever walked out of an England meeting  with that kind of negative thinking  I was carrying home a bushel of facts  to pull a problem but I couldn't have it.  Then they said you might hear a guy  or a girl get up  and tell them about the problems  that brought them to their first meeting  and you may say  poor guy, poor girl  Oh, misery.  They told me if I carried that  out of an England meeting  without sharing it  it was very negative.  They said I had a share  and thought if I had it  because life was carrying home  a bushel of facts to pull a problem  I couldn't have it.  And they were right.  And after a few more months from by  they said  let me give you a few more things  to think about.  They said you got to get completely  honest with yourself.  You got to get completely honest  with the overall problem  and you have to be completely  honest with the people who are trying to help you.  And if you don't  you won't make it.  If you don't  you won't make it.  Now I listen very carefully tonight  and I've done  everything they told me to do  and I've done it every day.  If you know why I've done it  I want it to get better.  I want it to get better.  Then they told me  I couldn't have any  reservations.  I couldn't have any  resentments.  I couldn't have any  little feelings for anything.  They told me I didn't have a right  to have any feelings.  They said if you have all these things  happening in your life  then you'll have reservations.  And when you have reservations  you get drunk.  And it's that simple.  Very simple.  And I listened  and I listened very carefully and I found exactly  what they told me to do when I've done it  every day.  You know why I've done it every day?  I want it to get better.  Every night they picked me up  and every night we went to a meeting  and I listened the best way  I know how about fun.  And once in a while  I said something.  That might have to say something.  Then I knew  they come to try  when you know you're getting a little bit better.  Now I thought I was  a strength and help guy all my life.  And by this time I'm going to move  job as a janitor.  I'm not a janitor, but that's  what I got as a job.  And I saved a few bucks  and I bought a set of weights.  I started working out.  Now I knew my parents  were very important to me and I knew  my body was still in.  I can't need something to go on.  And then I learned to give me the things  when I saw myself in a box  and I bought a suit for $11.  Now let me tell you now  I was a guy  and what ever made clothes on my life  were can-likes, little can-likes.  I signed this ring  and I made a virtual basket full of money  and I was impressed  with that one suit I bought.  I was so impressed that night  I went to a meeting and put everybody there  that I had just bought a suit  I was getting to see.  They didn't know  what made me feel so good about that.  I was so honest with my own feelings.  I didn't hide nothing.  I didn't say  I'm going to save up and buy a $300 suit.  I got a $11 class  when I bought the suit  in a hot shop  and I was grateful I was able  to do it.  No glad that clothes don't want to get taken to the bank.  I was great  in my life  along.  Coming up  on my first anniversary  they said  you're going to show your own meeting tonight  or a dump-on.  You know what to say.  You know what to say.  But I gave my own meeting  and I had my sponsor and two other guys  talk.  That's all I did was introduce them.  After the meeting  this guy came up to me and said  Frank,  do you know what I ever heard?  I  I  I told Frank  I didn't say anything  because that's why.  These are the kind of people I don't know.  Anyway  about a week later I said to my  sponsor  anyway I said  I got my first anniversary  I got to go up there talking  95 days sober  4 months sober  6 months sober  You never asked me to say nothing.  I'll tell you.  He didn't mean nothing to say.  He was right.  So he said  but Frank  if you finally fall with me  I'll drive you right from Lattifan State Hospital.  Because you don't finally fall  with people who are trying to help you.  I'm trying to help you.  I'm trying to save your family.  Don't find  fall with me.  This is before you think of finding fall.  We know  we saved my family.  This guy saved my family.  We'll go down and we'll go to the lab.  He's putting on a meeting. He's carrying a meeting.  He's our first baby Frank.  Frank  I got this nice blue children.  He's his group.  I get up  I smile  he's Frank. I'm an alcoholic.  I'm the lord of the Allenton group.  Just stop.  Who's saying other words?  And when I sat down  on the way  the only whispers in my ear  when I sat he assumed it wasn't the same.  There's not a much way that  he was very involved in the institution.  And he said, we're putting on a meeting  at the Parliamentary  he doesn't even want to speak it.  You know, I can't even feel telling.  And I said, oh  I just wonder if I pulled what I pulled  and who does that?  It was this time  we stand in front of him for 15 minutes.  So he called me to talk.  I was so scared.  Oh, you think I was nervous  you didn't I?  So I asked my wife how nervous I was.  I'm nervous all the time until I sat down.  I got up and I looked down  in the audience. I smiled.  A half a dozen guys I know by their first name.  There was he.  And I ended up  saying something  that I know he didn't like  but I did.  And I said, I'm going home tonight.  From there on  I got active and involved in it.  Active and involved.  Went for a lot of meetings.  Never so much talking.  Went for a lot of meetings every night.  The first one was on  I guess I went to a thousand meetings.  No big thing.  No big thing.  The reason that I went to a thousand meetings  or more  the first year, 20 years I was in AA  I wanted to get better.  I wanted to get better.  After I was sober  oh I don't know  a couple of years  I had no confidence  to talk.  I was told I was getting better.  I was working.  My brain was working a little bit better.  I wasn't as fearful as I used to be  but no confidence.  I walked in on a meeting one night.  Guy said to me,  I understand you used to be a  this business.  I said, yeah.  Years ago.  He said, I never saw a hair that's in that business  and he's looking for something.  He introduced me to the guy.  He said, would you like an interview  with my company?  I was scared to death.  Now  the guy that scared to death  this particular night  I made a bushel pass to  full of money with my brain.  I could talk to bank person.  I could talk to anyone.  I was  I was so nervous  but I believed it  and I was like, yeah.  So  he said, I'll set up an appointment.  I couldn't wait to get home.  I calmed up my fun.  I said, you know what happens  to me except for that hill tonight.  You know, he said  somebody's bubbling off  with your good job.  People leave this guy.  I  answered the, I went and I  talked to these people.  They offered me a job.  I took the job  and I stayed with the company for about 14 years.  That's after I  sold the trees during the half years  and I started to get very active in the 88  I started to talk a lot of  meanings that were after your talk  you know.  And one night  this guy came up to me and said  we have a brunt anniversary  in Everest.  We'd like you to be the speaker.  And I said, you know, I need to meet  if you need my sponsor  he speaks to all these anniversaries  and they, not me.  No, we want you.  I said I'll have to ask  my sponsor  anything.  I was sold for almost  four years.  I had to find out  from my sponsor  if it was put enough for me  was I ready for this.  No big ego on this guy  when I couldn't end up before  the 88 I and the ego was big  was the grand canyon.  I lost it here.  I grew up here.  I called my sponsor and said  anything I wanted to speak  at an anniversary in Everest  you know what he said, so what?  I thought he was going to say  oh you were right  you know, you paid it.  He said, oh an anniversary is  it's an anniversary  is usually a meaning  when it's good or bad.  That's how simple he got.  But he said, man you got to do that.  A lot of people go to conventions  a lot of people go to anniversaries  a lot of people go to  different meetings, big meetings  they usually don't go to meetings.  So give them help.  I said, wouldn't come with me.  He said, sure.  So he and I  and this guy is just  coming out all the time  coming over  they call me in the park  I get out my car  that's what I had to do  and they gave me a big embrace  my head fat was this big  I lose my pumps on my back  I said, what?  you know, thought I'd let my fat down  and then he pushed me down my head  and I let it go to your head Frank  I don't think you were that good.  That was my father.  He saved my family  he kept me right where I was supposed to be  and he's the one that told me  you have to go through what you have to go through  you have to get all the pain  you're going to have to feel all the pain  you're not going to miss anything  he said, if you are doing  what you're supposed to be doing  anyway  wherever you are  is where you're supposed to be  no matter how much it hurts  wherever you are  is where you're supposed to be  but he's in the enemy's house  to do it  I believe them  I listen to them  I sound what he's told me  and they go on  weeks go on, months go on  years go on and any guy  and  I became more active in A.A  everything he told me  I told people  who I was supposed to be  fine from A.A  you wanted me better  you do what I tell you  it works for me  it might work for you  wherever you are  is alright in A.A  if you are  that's where you're supposed to be  there's no double promotion  you have to go through all the pain  you have to go through  but one day  it starts to get a little bit easier  in one day  it starts to get a little more easier  and then it becomes a little  balanced in your life  and then how glad you are  you're here  they told me  they told me  you go to meeting  you go to meeting  I never heard 90 meetings in 90 days  maybe they said  but I never heard  what I did here was this  you go to meeting  you continue to go to meeting  and you go to meeting  then who do you want to go to meeting  now that makes a lot of sense  then you become comfortable  then you get some balance  in your life  they were right  all of them said were right  I never found it necessary  to find fault  with anyone who was trying to help me  never  never found it necessary  to find fault  with anyone who was trying to help me  with my problems  I found what they told me to do  I can't  I see the good feelings  I see the bad things  I had bad nights I shared  my first year in AA  was a nightmare  I had horrors  I had  nightmares you wouldn't believe  I'd wake up free  but every night it happened  the next day  I would share it with whoever picked me up  it's my house  I said you know what happened to me last night  you know what they used to say to me  you continue to do what you're doing  right now  and maybe it'll get better  and I heard it oh  oh  oh continue to do what you're doing today  and maybe it'll get better tomorrow  but I believe them  that's what makes me  I believe them  and they were right  they were right  I never found it necessary  one day in my life in AA  to find fault with anyone  who was trying to help me  this is why I'm here tonight  telling you  it worked  but you gotta work at it  you don't slide in  you don't slide back  you know  I've been in AA a long time  and the thousands of me  I got hundreds of pigeons  and I've run across  a lot of very successful people  people who are comfortable  that put balance in their life  life is nice  my wife and I were talking about this  the other night  how many people we know  have nice balance in their life  you know what these people are  the people who work the program  every day  every day  no pain, no strain, no nothing  nothing  but I have met  other people  who after they go back  they come out in months or years  they say  I think I'll go mighty  and proud  and then I'll tell you  we have a few more candles  and a few more cakes  and they say  I think I'll go to my own  meeting on Wednesday and they say  me  and then we find a real idiot  after a certain amount of time  they think I can follow it in  it don't work  it don't  work  you know  the first ten years that I was speaking in the A.A  if you was last  when I was talking I'd have got upset  they tell me  since I've lived in Florida  which is about nine years  that I know  I guess know  I don't see how but they say  I go psychically  I used to be worked  but they  but they  worked  if you worked at it  the day you stopped working at it  it don't work no more  you can take that to the back  then don't breathe  you don't  do like nothing  you better work  but then if you don't work  you get comfortable  and you get some balance  in your life  and you get some serenity  it is not the life people  and people start to like you  tired it works it's nice  I've thought for the longest time  I'm gonna have problems with it  but I've done  what they told me to do  when I got it every day  there was a time when I used to have all these bad  nightmares I thought about  the one night  they were dropping me off  with my sports assistant  he said  do what I used to do  first  they drove away  a couple of nights later  I'm going through a bad time  bad bad time  honestly I'm awake bad time  I get on my knees  now I could talk  for five days here  and I'd never talk about God  or prayer  or 12 steps  you know you commit an AA  you do what you're supposed to do  and all these things will happen to you  I don't have to say that  I can tell you that you can't make it  you better work this program  but  this night it happens  and I get on my knees  now when I was Catholic  I was an altar boy for 12 years  so I knew all the prayers  all the prayers you want I know  but this night  in fear  I get on my knees  and I say Dear God  I'm trying to do something with my life  in your prayers  that was the first form of prayer  I said hang in  no prayer to the light  no big thing happening  but I did pray that night  and every night  I said  many, many years  I get on my knees  before I go to bed  and I ask the power behind the program  of the after-house announcement  to help me with my after-house prayer  I have never met this night  never  never found it necessary  to say that  that means  work on it  but it's not you  it works  every day  I get up  I get on my knees  and I ask the power behind the program  of the after-house announcement  to help me with my after-house prayer  let me do something  that's right today  I get up I do that  my wife and I  we have parties  she goes to work  I go to work  life is good  I went to her from home  she waits for me to come home  we're associated  with people in the A.A  we've got an A.A. meeting  she's more involved in A.A.  life is very, very good  I never found it necessary  from when my brain started to clear up  to change any of the rules  because there's no rules in A.A.  I got rules for you  I got rules for you  you may not think they're rules  but they're you better  you better  and I've been doing it  I do it every day  I am the most happy  contented guy  to ever do on this platform  remember I said  I am a very happy contented guy  and I owe every single citizen  not the house department  to the change in my content  to the clothes on my back  if you don't think you do  you probably get here  one drink  before you've lost it all  remember that  let me remind you that  some of you might be fooling around with the program  there isn't a person in this room  there isn't a person in the house  there isn't a person in the cloud  that can tell me  what will happen to them  if they take another drink of alcohol  you don't know where you're going to go  what you'll do when you get there  how it will affect you  mentally or physically  or if you'll ever have another day of time  remember  when you get it right here  you don't know where you're going to go  what you'll do when you get there  how it will affect you  mentally or physically  or if you'll ever have another day of time  I've had a lot of people say to me  I came in here  I came tired of the ride  I had a nice job  no one in this room  has more respect for themselves  than I did  before I took that one drink  that put me on the ground  that I couldn't get off  that tore me right down  of my hands and knees  it had made a nothing happen  it took my brain  it scrambled on my jaw  I remember one night  it was a skid row and I had enough money  to get a $0.55  in an all night movie  but before I went in I had two bottles  that must fit our wine  $0.85 a bottle  my friend and I went in  about an hour in the movie  he passed the dollar on me  and I'm sitting there  now I have been in this movie many times  but this night  I started to smell the place  I could smell it  it was rotten  it was filthy and so was I  and I looked around  and I said, dear God  where am I doing here?  but like he asked about me  he was a coward  and I was gone  I couldn't take that kind of pain  so I picked up the bottle of wine  $0.85 and before I had it  finished  I was enjoying a cowboy movie  that's how a cowboy movie was  destroyed the brain  it destroyed the brain  it destroyed the brain  if you don't think it's ten  maybe you should check yourself  in somewhere tonight  alcohol will destroy  everyone in this room  absolutely  you can drink again  it'll take your health  your wealth, your sanity, your freedom  your dignity, your self respect  walking over  and before you want to drink  put it all on the floor  because that's what it's about  whether you like it or not  that's what it'll cost you  and most of all it'll cost you your sanity  and you may never  never have an opportunity  to put a man in your den  I didn't make that up  I didn't involve  an institution  of many many years in AA  and I see people  sitting out in meetings  in the prison  in that meeting on the street  and we still don't believe  that's what happens  it's just  I just  stick to my stomach  when I say people say  it won't happen to me  I'm in control  if you're in control of your life  you're going to spend this meeting tonight  if you're in control of your life  you're going to come to the prison in a meeting  you're going to look after the health  and in order to get the health  you've got to get complete surrender  here I am, Allah  find me  the people I know will help you  but they've got to let them help you  you can't beat me  you can't do it  no way it's up  my way it's up  I've done everything  I've ever wanted to do in this life  I've just been stressed up  trouble when it was so clear  when I got out of the way  I knew they call me  complete impoverished surrender  and made me without a care  I believed them  they were right in their work  in their work  and it's been working  every day since  my life is good  the people I hang around with  their life is good  we're reasonably  consensus happy people  you know  people say I'm not a high guy  I'm not a high guy  my life is good  a lot of wonderful  things have happened to me  I started to make a little progress  I had this job I showed you for 14 years  about 7 years into the job  I got a nice house  with my old house  you know  way out of my  character  I deserve  I was a nice guy  I did do it to have  nice things  then  maybe 6, 7, 8 years  later I bought a whole  town in New Hampshire  life was coming along pretty good  I'm telling you about the serious things  because I don't know if they're going to happen  you may say in the same job for 50 years  but these things  happened to me  because I was sober in 88  I done what I was supposed to do in 88  the opportunity came  and I got  I got rid of the whole town  in New Hampshire  I went to Florida  I was in Florida  a couple of weeks I joined the group  I got active in the group  the day before  my life was good  everything was good  if nothing  more happened to me  in my life  I would have been  the most fortunate guy  that ever came to an 88  year  but better things would have happened  you didn't believe  better things would have happened  I was staring at me  I was about to stare at me  and walk on a Sunday night  I looked out in the audience  I'd seen this beautiful drunk  and I just walked  I got a knee hurt  so before I got to the meeting  I walked all the way  I introduced myself  I jumped right  she jumped off me  we talked  that song was Friday with my anniversary  I invited her to my anniversary  at our anniversary down there  we had meeting meetings and all that good stuff  and I was going to be the speaker  after the meeting  she came  and after the meeting  she said to me  I didn't know what you were going to say  but I knew what you were going to say  I just didn't know how you were going to say it  and I kind of looked at her funny  and I said okay  that's funny  two days later I was to see a woman  who was in the hospital with cancer  who was an 88  so I said if you'd like to come with me  to the hospital to visit this woman at 88  I'll take you off the chain  and send her a hug  to keep it going  I told you what you were going to say to this woman at the hospital  and that night  she was a Chinese dinner  and that night we walked on the beach  that's kind of romantic huh  the next night  she came to my house to death  we were going to have a dinner every night spent  we weren't together for years  and she said to me one night  if you'd like to get married  that's a great idea  and we were married  we were married  two years and two months  the lovely lady sitting over there  I thought  that I had got it all  and my life was complete  and I was barely involved in the air  and I was happy to spend the time with her  she had made my life  that more  complete  and a very very happy  contented job  every night  including tonight  she'd be on one side of the bed  I'll be on the other  we'll thank the cow behind the program  of A.A.  for another good day in A.A  another good day in life  and I'll thank the higher power  for her  and my life is good  the girl life is good  become good  we're in action  we really enjoy ourselves  we had a nice  life here  we had a nice motel  things go right tonight  we might take a while  come right down here  I say it  just like you  I thought  the other day  there was a special fact  that called a skill to reflect  and I said  what a nice ceremony it is  to wake up in the morning  make each time you're walking along  you pick it up  and you're all right still  from the front page  and it takes a good breathe  we can't do that  I can  to you  A.A. will work  if you let it go  I had a vision one time  I recommended the city hospital  in Boston, a very wealthy guy  he spent money like an immigrant  at that particular time  I was a chef and the Boston father  was making 90 bucks a week  that really had nothing to do  with it, but this guy was  an immediate and very insolvent  one of those guys  all kinds of degrees  big matters  we left him in the hospital  he said  as he saved his life he was leaving  the point is this  they saved his life, they put him in a healthy life  and then all these very insolventive friends came  and blah blah blah  so anyway  I went to see him in the hospital  I brought him a big book  he thanked me for saving his life  I said I'll pick you up  I'll pick you up when A.A. meets  like they did to me  fine  we lived in Maine for about six months  and he was getting better  he was getting a little bit better  he knew what we lived  he knew what to practice  he was a lawyer  he knew all he started to get together  then one night  he said  thank you you're a great guy  anything I could ever do for you  but you let me know  he's just like  he's meaning to take anything to it  I take him down a skid row  a soft band  I mean I used to take him to meetings  where half the guys in the room had pineclaws  in their pockets  he said they're not my type  I said what  I said everyone  in this room you just type  we're all here  with an alcoholic problem  I don't care if you come from Maine  or where you come from  Yale or Yale or Harlem  everyone in this room  with an alcoholic problem  is the same type  there's only one big book  it's for the young  the old  the rich the poor  the boys the girls  one big book  and if you don't think so  you've got three problems  they didn't make books for boys  they didn't make books for girls  and they didn't make books for old people  and young people  rich people and poor people  one big book  it's for you  it's for me  and we better work this program  the exact same way  everyone in this room is my type  you've got an alcoholic problem  I've got an alcoholic problem  we're the events  I work at the best way I know how  you work at the best way you know how  we're still even  if you don't think I'm your type  you've got a problem  if I don't think I'm my type  I've got a problem  no rules  for anyone  the same rules for everyone  there's only one big book  and it's for all  you and listen  he says  that's not my type  listen to him  this guy  all his crying  all his flaccid walls  all the money he had  he couldn't get a girl with head  you're an alcoholic first  everything else is second  you don't have a second  unless you're an alcoholic  there's no second  there has to be  the number one thing  the number one thing in my life  what are we going to do about it  if we don't make it number one  we don't have a number two  he resumed to believe that  he didn't want to know  he didn't want me to know he was drinking  so he went to Miami and broke up  there's a sick guy who was watching  Miami and broke up  he ended up in a crying out place  in Connecticut and he died  I'll fix you my right arm  after the show  look like  if you're so much for that show  on the night  please do everything you could  to stay sober in AA  you don't have that opportunity  to do what I do  you
